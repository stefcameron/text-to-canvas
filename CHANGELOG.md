# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v2.0.0

- __Breaking:__ Updated minimum supported of Node to `>=22` and builds now target `ES2022` at minimum.

## v1.2.1

- Added warning in TypeScript/JSDoc for the exported `getTextHeight()` function about it not supporting multi-line text.

## v1.2.0

- New `strokeColor` and `strokeWidth` text formatting options to control the outline of the text ([#292](https://github.com/stefcameron/text-to-canvas/issues/292)).
    - Note that due to how the `strokeText()` and `measureText()` Canvas APIs work, the stroke is __not considered__ in text placement. Setting a large width will result in the stroke "bleeding" outside the text box.

## v1.1.2

- Fixed bug where `drawText()` config `fontColor` option was not being included in the base font format used to render the text ([#64](https://github.com/stefcameron/text-to-canvas/issues/64)).

## v1.1.1

### Changed

- README updated to include the new `overflow` option in the API docs.

## v1.1.0

### Added

- New `overflow?: boolean` config parameter for `drawText()` API: True (default) to allow overflow; false to clip text to box.

## v1.0.0

- First official release ðŸŽ‰
